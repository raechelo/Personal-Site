      <p>I'm a software developer with a passion for helping people and developing clean cut, striking web and mobile applications. I like to think I started this career in my early teens on websites like Quizilla and Myspace, however I've been developing professoinally for just under a year.</p>
      <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in English with an emphasis in Creative Writing and a minor in Classical Humanities. After earning my degree, I worked for a couple publishing companies which helped me to realize where my passions lie and how many people I can help in doing so.</p>
